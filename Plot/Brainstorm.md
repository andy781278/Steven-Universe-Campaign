#Plot
Hook: A high ranking gem is secretly de facto, hiding as a [spy](app://obsidian.md/Daggerheart/adversaries/Spy.md) and striking deals with the [FPC](app://obsidian.md/Worldbuilding/Factions/The%20Free%20Planets%20Coalition.md) to gain favors once they leave. Depending on what the player wants, they can choose to either help or stop the gem.

Let’s do a 3 Act structure, with 5 sessions per act. Act 1 will be getting used to the world, missions will center on going to a place and doing something that’s relevant to the world while completing missions. Let’s have 1 arc for 1 person, and sometimes we have arcs intertwining.
