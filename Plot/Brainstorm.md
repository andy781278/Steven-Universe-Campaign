# Act 1
Act 1 is all about getting used to the world of the Gems and the Aliens. We should go around and explore, fuck around, and have fun.

## Kris
### Backstory
Kris is born in the human zoo, and is innately curious. They always ask questions about why they live the way they do, and thus started exploring. With some lock picking and stealth skills, she sneaked out of her habitat and wandered about the gem facility until she was caught. The manager of the human zoo, HollyBlue Agate, a member of the hidden rebellion Morrigon, saw potential in Kris, so she trained her to be a secret assassin, doing jobs and shattering gems for Holly so the Morrigons can gain more control and secretly sabotage the Diamond Authority.
### Progression

- [x] Kris escapes the zoo via sunbeam, a fast small starfighter that can camouflage, given by Hollyblue Agate.  
- [x] She flies to Jackson and hides until the right moment.  
- [x] Kris is given a tablet to communicate with Holly, the tablet is unlocked with the secret phrase that she’ll choose when she first uses it, and Kris can only communicate to Holly through this device, and nobody else.  
- [x] Tablet lights up with Holly giving Kris her first assignment, she says this will be a test to see whether or not Kris is capable of working for her.  
- [x] First Task: Kill Prism Facet 7J6 Cut 9KK, who is the head coordinator for colony recon and threat detection at Jackson. She usually works alone in her control tower within the colony, which is the only part of the building visible above ground. There are 2 rubies guarding the entrance to the tower, which is otherwise pretty isolated. The kill is easy and can be done alone. This ensures that the attack happens successfully.   
- [x] Kris’ ship is destroyed in the process, forcing her to find other ways to travel.  
- [x] Kris informs of mission success  
- [ ] Holly Blue convenes with Pad on Pensive, discusses the next tasks and the usefulness of Kris for their mission.  
- [ ] Second Task: Kill Sanchez Hernandez or Mech Man, one a pimped out gangster in Catan, leader of the Chill Dudas, a Goblino. The other is a fully mech-ed out cyborg that's more cyborg than creature, no one knows what species they actually were. The Chill Dudas are a massive pain in the ass for Morrigans because of gang warfare between the two. Disrupting the gang by killing one of the key figures can get them off of Morrigan's back. Difficult kill because of his buddies, but it’s manageable with a team.  
- [ ] Holly Blue meets with Pad again on Melancholy. They discuss the next mission, and Pad asserts the importance of Kris’ next task.  
- [ ] Third Task: Kill Sapphire Facet 996 Cut BXM, the lead advisor for the Oxoron colony. This will ensure a smooth invasion. Since Sapphire was cracked from a workplace accident, her future vision is shoddy, which presents an opportunity to take her out of the picture for good. Eazy kill but difficult to get in and out without notice, since she has personal bodyguards and lives in a heavily fortified and secured mansion. Perhaps sneaking is the best.  
- [ ] Holly Blue meets with Pad for the final time on Oxoron if succeed else on P9. They discuss the future uses for Kris, and decide to use her as incriminating evidence against Morrigan.
## Chrys
### Backstory
Chrys used to punch a tree day and night, it was his best friend. There was also a tree that fell on him one time, and it hurt. The tree is angry for all those years of being punched, so after Chrys left, the tree plots revenge for years. They managed to study cybernetics and became a cyborg by controlling a mech with himself in the center, controlling it by excreting the necessary juices at the right spot. They went on to Catan and started a gang called the Chill Dudas along with Sanchez Hernandez.
### Progression
- [x] Mech Man chills with Sanchez in Chill Dudaz territory.  
- [ ] Mech Man spots Chrys and tries to capture him.  
- [ ] If successfully captured, Mech Man reveals his true form, tree. He then reveals the truth to Chrys, that he’s been searching for him not because of revenge, but because he missed being punched. He hated the pain, but he also missed it, he slowly learned that he loved it. He then punches Chrys repeatedly until death as a way of saying thank you, and to make him feel the same.  
- [ ] If defeated, Mech Man has a back up plan, and uploads his juices (consciousness) into a pod and launches it back to Polymoria, targeting the tree that once hit Chrys in order to take over the tree and be reborn anew to exact his revenge once again.  
- [ ] New tree builds another Mech and uses it to come back to Catan, where he will try to find the Chill Dudaz.  
- [ ] If the Chill Dudaz are gone, the tree will try to track down and find Chrys and kill him.
