## Overall Plot
### Backstory
Morrigon plans to retake Oxoron from DA.
### Progression
- [x] Morrigan is tasked to complete a mural at the newly established colony Jackson for Yellow.  
- [x] Colony Overseer Heliodor and Barracks Manager Shadow Agate greets Morrigan and gives them an orientation, which includes an underground kindergarten built in a cave, the crew barrack (Introduce Danny Jacob), and resource mines.
- [x] Suddenly, communications are cut from the outside, and Shadow Agate runs off to sound the alarm while Heliodor asks Morrigan's group to do the same while they deal with the intruders. Then Heliodor runs to the barracks and leads the local Citrines and Jaspers to battle.  
- [x] No matter the choice, Morrigan’s group will be caught in a battle started by a small group of rebel gems. They ride in with hovercrafts and start cutting. The battle is unexpected, it takes place in small tight corridors and hallways, with 1 room that they can run to. The lights can be cut out half way through the fight, making Morrigan’s team blind with disadvantage, while the rebels put on night vision goggles. The rebels fought as if they knew the colony layout and where to go, and the power cut was definitely intended. Their goal is to place down bombs and blow up the colony to the ground. They complete their mission after players are really slow at dispatching them. They vandalize by destroying murals and spray paint their symbols, **Morrigon was here.**  
- [x] After winning the battle against the rebels, they fled, leaving messages in the battlefield, saying “Morrigon Was Here”. If the rebels win, they leave, and blow up the station, and Morrigan’s crew will be trapped on the planet. They will be able to make it out of the buried sands after hours of digging with rolls, and they will then need to survive in the harsh wind.  
- [x] Morrigan rests in Jackson, then spends time completing the mural. During this time, she spots a gem, Shadow Agate, that’s suspiciously nervous. Eventually, she spots her leaving a secret message in a crevice within a random wall. If the rebels win, then Morrigans will travel to a forest that shields them from the winds, and find a stranded Shadow Agate who asks them to help her repair the broken signal tower next to her. She’s nervous, because it’s her who broke the signal towers, and she who shut off the power earlier, but now that she’s stranded, she can’t fix it. If this works, then a ship will come and rescue them back to Homeworld, where she will proceed with the story as usual. If not, then the message will be either in her chambers or the info can be found around the signal tower or even found from the destroyed Jackson colony.  
- [x] The message is a meeting location and time, which is in the back of a factory in Sector Y7Z6 on Homeworld in 4 days.  
- [x] While passing by Xelthor, an old message is broadcasted and picked up by Morrigan’s ship, which contains coordinates and an SOS signal. The coords lead to a barren field filled with drab grey bushes. There is a crashed spaceship ruin that’s been here for around 2000 years. The interiors are dusty, but clean. A large portion of the ship was destroyed in the crash that landed it there, but in one of the working rooms, a glitched transmitter randomly broadcasted a signal that was made 2000 years ago. Traces of hurriedness, items scattered about. Reactivating the ship's central console reveals that there were 2 passengers 2000 years ago, and that was a Bismuth and a Padparascha. Video footage shows them frantically getting on the ship, supported by a Globgor, who stayed behind while Bis and Pad cried. The footage showed a little bit of the outside, which is a lush green forest, a common environment to find Globgors. There’s also loot I guess. All this time, there were Kleenexes hiding in the ship, scavengers who’ve lost their food source from the ship’s leaking core. The core was cracked when the crash happened, and has been leaking radioactively, polluting the environment and killing food sources, starving local wildlife Kleenexes, although no one cares about them anyways. A choice was given to salvage the core or destroy it or leave it. Destroying it saves the Kleenexes and the local ecosystem, it also reactivates the main console that opens doors to some rooms containing loot.   
- [x] Morrigan receives a call from Pink diamond for weekly reports. Hearing news of a yellow colony assault, Pink is excited and asks for details, but thinks it’s too much of a bad news and such a bad timing for yellow, so she decides to not inform her about it. It’s not her colony anyways, it’s not her issue. Morrigan is then excused and told to not worry about it, she would go back home to the green house and chill.  
- [x] Few days later, Morrigan is summoned by pink, this time in yellow’s ship, where yellow and pink argue over pink’s negligence to report an invasion of one of her colonies. Yellow lacks proper agents to investigate the meetup, so she delegates Morrigan to investigate and report it directly to yellow instead, saying that for pink’s negligence, she’ll simply take one of her gems to do the job instead.  
- [ ] At the meeting place and time, Shadow Agate convenes with 4 other gems, 2 Amethysts, 1 Jasper, and 1 Zircon. They discuss the attack on Jackson, hinting at their involvement, and how Shadow Agate sabotaged the recon system so that the rebels could sneak in. Then, Shadow Agate talked about meeting Morrigan, and that they will alert Bis of her existence, see what she thinks. Other gems will be surprised to hear Morrigan’s existence. “She’s Real?” “BS\!” “No…”  
- [ ] Shadow Agate will return to Jackson, while the 4 rebels discretely fly off to Catan, using invisible cloaking technology to get past the gems.  
- [ ] In Catan, the rebels meet up with Bis, who is surprised to hear of Morrigan, and is conflicted about her next actions. She also blames Shadow and the 4 rebels for orchestrating the battle, since Jackson is a new colon, and the stunt pulled a lot of attention, despite its best intentions, which is to disrupt the colony, and give more time to a bigger attack on Oxoron that’s happening right now, in order to free it.  
- [ ] Bis moves to another building, where she speaks to Pad over the phone. They ultimately decide to not chase after her, let bygones be by gone, and focus up on the rebellion efforts. They also talk about a newly rising rebellion called the Crystal Gems, and that maybe they can go for a partnership.  
- [ ] The attack on Oxoron has been planned for years, but now the stars have aligned, and a perfect opportunity has come up to take it back from the gems and free the Talubians. Bis and Pad gets on a ship to Oxoron, starts the cloaking device along with \~20 other Morrigon ships full with rebels, and flies to Oxoron.  
- [ ] The attack on Oxoron starts after Bis and Pad’s arrival. Their target is a gem controlled city called Tubeula, once the capital of Oxorn, now the headquarters for the gems to monitor Talubians. Hidden spies turn off defensive gun turrets, allowing Morrigons to sneak into the city. Then, they surprise the gems with a massive bombing on the administrative capital building. A large-scale battle occurs between gems. The rebellion wins by default.  
- [ ] Pad and Bis make an announcement through the broadcast, saying that all Talubains are now free, declared by the Morrigons. They then occupy Oxoron for 2 weeks, securing their position and wiping out gems hiding that are still loyal to the diamonds. Then, they will bring the willing freed Talubians to the FPC, and Oxoron becomes Morrigon headquarters, and the Morrigon name becomes famous and acknowledged by the Diamonds and also FPC.

## Jas Kween / No King
### Backstory
Jas and No are dumb because of poor birthing conditions from when they were emerging in the kindergarten. While birthing, there was a random rock in the way that wasn’t detected in the scans done by peridots. Jas had to ram through the rock, causing a generally lower intelligence.
### Progression
- [x] Jas meets a peridot who ridicules Jas for their stupidity after finding out they can't do a simple action. The peridot advises Jas to bathe in diamond water in order to clean out the impurities in their gem and become smart again. Diamond water is created by mixing water with any amount of diamond concentrate, which is a combination or all diamond sweats. This concentrate can heal cracks, re-fuse shattered gems, and clean all impurities. This stuff is hard to get, and priced at around 2 million Rads per 10 milliliter, and you can’t trade for it, since it’s only gifted to elite gems. The only way to get one would be to request it from your superiors, in hopes they are kind enough, and you’ll get it in a few thousand years.
- [x] There is a rumor about possible shipments of Diamond concentrate being stolen by rebels, overheard by Jas.
- [x] At the crime scene, a hidden note could be found that indicates a location for a secret deal to sell off the diamond concentrate to a gang called the Chill Dudaz. The location is at Hunchbacks.
- [ ] After 4 days, the dealing happens. Mech Man leads the Chill Dudaz meets the rebels. A disagreement happens between the prices, and they start fighting. The Chill Dudaz wins and takes the diamond concentrate forcefully.
- [ ] The Chill Dudaz takes the concentrate back to their base on Catan, where it is planned to be sold off again to the Piratars.
- [ ] In order to trade with the Piratars, one must first have a trade agreement with them, which can be done with either a generous amount of donations or show yourself as a valuable trader.
- [ ] With the trade agreement, you are given the next location and time Macan appears, and you can trade with them there.
- [ ] The Chill Dudaz goes to the next location within the Solar Dragons in 2 weeks.  
- [ ] They enter Macan and perform the deal successfully.
## Kris
### Backstory
Kris is born in the human zoo, and is innately curious. They always ask questions about why they live the way they do, and thus started exploring. With some lock picking and stealth skills, she sneaked out of her habitat and wandered about the gem facility until she was caught. The manager of the human zoo, HollyBlue Agate, a member of the hidden rebellion Morrigon, saw potential in Kris, so she trained her to be a secret assassin, doing jobs and shattering gems for Holly so the Morrigons can gain more control and secretly sabotage the Diamond Authority.
### Progression

- [x] Kris escapes the zoo via sunbeam, a fast small starfighter that can camouflage, given by Hollyblue Agate.  
- [x] She flies to Jackson and hides until the right moment.  
- [x] Kris is given a tablet to communicate with Holly, the tablet is unlocked with the secret phrase that she’ll choose when she first uses it, and Kris can only communicate to Holly through this device, and nobody else.  
- [x] Tablet lights up with Holly giving Kris her first assignment, she says this will be a test to see whether or not Kris is capable of working for her.  
- [x] First Task: Kill Prism Facet 7J6 Cut 9KK, who is the head coordinator for colony recon and threat detection at Jackson. She usually works alone in her control tower within the colony, which is the only part of the building visible above ground. There are 2 rubies guarding the entrance to the tower, which is otherwise pretty isolated. The kill is easy and can be done alone. This ensures that the attack happens successfully.   
- [x] Kris’ ship is destroyed in the process, forcing her to find other ways to travel.  
- [x] Kris informs of mission success  
- [ ] Holly Blue convenes with Pad on Pensive, discusses the next tasks and the usefulness of Kris for their mission.  
- [ ] Second Task: Kill Sanchez Hernandez or Mech Man, one a pimped out gangster in Catan, leader of the Chill Dudas, a Goblino. The other is a fully mech-ed out cyborg that's more cyborg than creature, no one knows what species they actually were. The Chill Dudas are a massive pain in the ass for Morrigans because of gang warfare between the two. Disrupting the gang by killing one of the key figures can get them off of Morrigan's back. Difficult kill because of his buddies, but it’s manageable with a team.  
- [ ] Holly Blue meets with Pad again on Melancholy. They discuss the next mission, and Pad asserts the importance of Kris’ next task.  
- [ ] Third Task: Kill Sapphire Facet 996 Cut BXM, the lead advisor for the Oxoron colony. This will ensure a smooth invasion. Since Sapphire was cracked from a workplace accident, her future vision is shoddy, which presents an opportunity to take her out of the picture for good. Eazy kill but difficult to get in and out without notice, since she has personal bodyguards and lives in a heavily fortified and secured mansion. Perhaps sneaking is the best.  
- [ ] Holly Blue meets with Pad for the final time on Oxoron if succeed else on P9. They discuss the future uses for Kris, and decide to use her as incriminating evidence against Morrigan.
## Chrys
### Backstory
Chrys used to punch a tree day and night, it was his best friend. There was also a tree that fell on him one time, and it hurt. The tree is angry for all those years of being punched, so after Chrys left, the tree plots revenge for years.

They went on to Catan and started a gang called the Chill Dudas along with Sanchez Hernandez.
### Progression
- [x] Mech Man chills with Sanchez in Chill Dudaz territory.  
- [ ] Mech Man spots Chrys and tries to capture him.  
- [ ] If successfully captured, Mech Man reveals his true form, tree. He then reveals the truth to Chrys, that he’s been searching for him not because of revenge, but because he missed being punched. He hated the pain, but he also missed it, he slowly learned that he loved it. He then punches Chrys repeatedly until death as a way of saying thank you, and to make him feel the same.  
- [ ] If defeated, Mech Man has a back up plan, and uploads his juices (consciousness) into a pod and launches it back to Polymoria, targeting the tree that once hit Chrys in order to take over the tree and be reborn anew to exact his revenge once again.  
- [ ] New tree builds another Mech and uses it to come back to Catan, where he will try to find the Chill Dudaz.
