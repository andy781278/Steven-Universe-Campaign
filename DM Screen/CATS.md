**Concept**  
You work under the Diamond Authority in the gem society. You listen to the Diamond’s orders without question, that is the purpose of your existence. One day, you are tasked with tracking down a high ranking gem that is secretly de facto, hiding as a spy and striking deals with the FPC to gain favors once they leave. Would you track down and shatter the gem, or will you listen to them and join the coalition to stop the Diamonds’ tyranny?  

**Aim**  
The aim of this campaign is to have a fun good time as a group, going on weekly missions with a grander overall design secretly at play that slowly reveals itself. The aim is to replicate the Gem Society and what it feels like to be a gem in such a world.

**Tone**  
Yes: **Adventurous**, Funny, Goofy, Gritty, Lighthearted, Political, **Whimsical,** Dramatic
No: Cozy, Intimate, Romantic, Scary
Basically, goofy most of the time, not taking itself that seriously, but when important moments come, focuses more on drama and becomes darker and more serious. Basically, 80% goofy fun adventures and 20% gritty dramatic lore episodes.
