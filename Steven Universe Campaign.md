# **Character Backstories**

## **Morrigan**
### **Act 2**

2 possible outcomes, the PCs stop the rebellion on Oxoron, or they fail to stop the rebellion.  
**PCs Succeed**  
The rebellion is stopped and one of the leaders is captured while the other manages to slip away. Morrigon is severely hurt and leaves the spotlight for a session or two, where they secretly plan for a revenge, this time focusing on taking down Morrigan instead.  
**PCs Fail**  
The rebellion succeeds, Oxoron is freed, and the Morrigons turn their focus on taking down Morrigan instead.

Either way, the plan is the same, except if PCs succeed, they have 1 less leader to worry about.  
**Plan**  
Morrigon will try to sabotage Morrigan, by first investigating her whereabouts and her history through homeworld. Two Morrigon gems from a high ranking, a Jade and a Nacre, got into inner social circles of other elite gems to ask around until they found a friend of Morrigan, an Emerald who was a neighbor and commissioned Morrigan regularly to build murals for her colonies. Through a ball that they attended together, they found out Morrigan’s job, diamond, and holdings, including the green house, her main base on homeworld.   
Later, they find her base, the green house, and then burn it down and “kidnap” all the organic life in it, liberating them and bringing them to the Morrigon side. The green house is square shaped with 5 floors, it has 4 entrances from 4 sides, all on the 3rd floor. It is powered by its own generators located on the 1st floor, powered by organic matter. The Morrigons first recon the greenhouse with camera drones that takes pictures of the green house and its interior with x-ray cameras. The drones were seen by 1 ruby guard, who didn’t think much of it, since it’s a pretty common drone. Then, after 2 days, the attack happens. A bunch of Morrigon gems infiltrate the greenhouse under the guise of minions of Morrigan’s friend Emerald who wanted to admire artworks of Morrigan. Then, they sneak into the generator room and destroy it. Without the generator, the lights are shut off, and Morrigon gems attacks and shatters the ruby guards, then takes away all the specimens, then destroying most of the artworks in the green house, before setting it all on fire.  
During the raid, Morrigons took some important files about Morrigan. Choose one:

- Ship records that indicate they went to a destroyed ship on Xelthor after being on Jackson, while having no business being there. Further investigations on Xelthor revealed that it is in fact a rebel ship.  
-   
- If Jas Kween successfully retrieved the diamond concentrate, there would be traces of it being used, but no records of it being gifted. Unapproved diamond concentrate usage is highly illegal, since it is government property and is only distributed to the most elite of gems.  
- 

Then, Morrigons will fabricate evidence to convince the gem society that Morrigan was a traitor and a spy that helped the FPC. Morrigan will be forced to flee and hide in FPC territories, and try to prove her innocence. Every step along Morrigon’s sabotage leaves some hint to reveal a pathway that can be followed to eventually get evidence of Morrigon’s involvement, but this requires them to go all over the galaxy while hiding from the gem empire. PCs need to retrieve 3 pieces of evidence to piece together counter evidence against Morrigan betrayal.  
After that’s done, Morrigan all Morrigan needs is to return to homeworld and make a case for her innocence, which will start a trial,   
Ideas:

- Hollyblue Agate is brainwashed by Morrigons?  
- Yellow attends the trial out of curiosity, and asks Morrigan to prove her loyalty by shattering a rebel gem, which will have revenge consequences.
