# **Character Backstories**

## **Morrigan**

Morrigan is an Morganite gem, a member of Pink Diamond’s court, and one of the elites of gem society. Born on homeworld 27,594 years ago, Morganite is a specialized gem whose job is to create art and sculptures for pink diamonds. She was the first one of its kind, introduced as one of the first waves of entertainers type gems similar to Spinel and some pearls. Morrigan built beautiful art, constructed from the local life forms of planets they conquered. She created palanquins, sculptures, and murals out of flora and fauna, and in doing so grew to understand life no other in the empire. In terms of assets, Morrigan has a massive greenhouse mansion called the greenhouse filled with all kinds of plants, creatures, or fauna she’s gathered throughout her journey. This mansion is her main base of operation, which is guarded by rose quartzes, Jaspers, and other pink quartzes. Besides her greenhouse, Morrigan also owns various zoos of creatures throughout gem controlled territories, and also helped build the human zoo for pink diamond. Morrigan has no official fleets or armatas, but she does have personal bodyguards made up of her most interested faunas she’s gathered throughout the galaxy; she's eccentric for that. She also owns a pink handship called the Green Thumb for all her general traveling (the thumb is green). She has around 30 million Rads, earning \~100k per commissioned artwork. She earns \~200k per year, which is considered a little below average for Beryls.

### **Project M Arc**

**Backstory**  
\~4000 years ago, with an increasing number of discovered space-tech civilizations that oppose the diamond authority, Yellow created project M as an experiment to try and engineer an ultimate virus that spreads without control, is hard to trace, and can annihilate all organic life it touches. They called this hypothetical virus **Malaise**.  
Yellow wanted to keep this experiment a secret, so she built laboratories on a satellite orbiting a colony planet called K2-18B in the system of JXJ. Scientists consist of Labradorites (laber), Morganites (managers), and some Peridots (tech people). Samples were collected from various alien species, and after 2000 years of trial and error, a prototype was made.  
The prototype is a self-replicating nanobot that can conceal itself to near perfection, dodging the immune systems of the host and also the best detectors the world has to offer. The machine consumes the host's nutrients to build more of itself until the host dies of malnutrition.  
The prototype was tested on the remaining Globgors on Sector 3, which worked well, perhaps too well. Along with all organic beings, all gems somehow also contracted the Malaise and started malfunctioning from a lack of energy, eventually retreating into their gem, unable to come out again, permanently. A dozen gems contracted the virus and got stuck inside their gem, and the entirety of Sector 3 got wiped out.  
Yellow quickly covered up the incident, rejuvenated any gem involved, and erased all documentation, except for 2 gems. A Bismuth and a Padparadscha from Sector 3, who escaped thanks to the sacrifice of their lover, a local Globgor called Jack. Originally, Bis and Pad warned Jack and wanted to secretly transport him to another Sector, but after the virus broke out, all travel to other locations was restricted, so Jack intentionally got himself infected to steal a key to start a ship for Bis and Pad to escape.  
The ship, unfortunately, crashed and landed on a nearby planet called Xelthor. The ship was destroyed, and the landing poofed both of them, and their gems got stuck, jammed inside broken machinery, for 1000 years. After 1000 years, Xelthor was conquered by the Diamonds, and the land site was discovered. Bis and Pad were saved and returned to their homeworld. They tried to adapt to the new world and their new life, and it almost worked, but they came across a new piece of information: that the Malaise owes its existence to a certain Morganite called Morrigan, who supplied Project M with the necessary research specimens. Without Morrigan, perhaps Jack would have died. Morrigan is the last connection to Project M left. Naturally, they blamed her and started plotting revenge.   
For 1000 years, they gathered forces, created a rebellion in secret, all the while keeping up the appearance of lowly worker gems in the eyes of the diamonds. They helped create the Free Planets Coalition by sabotaging DA intel, they named their rebellion “Morrigon”, the name of the gem they're after, plus gone, since they want her gone. The rebellion grew in secret, leaving its name on every corner. Slowly, the rebellion became more than just petty revenge; it became a symbol for anti-authoritarian and basic gem rights. Instead of protesting, they secretly sabotage gem operations to shift them in their favor. To this day, the operation is undiscovered to the gem public, and the idea of taking revenge on Morrigan is long forgotten.

### **Act 1**

- Morrigan is tasked to complete a mural at the newly established colony Jackson for Yellow.  
- Colony Overseer Heliodor and Barracks Manager Shadow Agate greets Morrigan and gives them an orientation, which includes an underground kindergarten built in a cave, the crew barrack (Introduce Danny Jacob), and resource mines.  
- Suddenly, communications are cut from the outside, and Shadow Agate runs off to sound the alarm while Heliodor asks Morrigan's group to do the same while they deal with the intruders. Then Heliodor runs to the barracks and leads the local Citrines and Jaspers to battle.  
- No matter the choice, Morrigan’s group will be caught in a battle started by a small group of rebel gems. They ride in with hovercrafts and start cutting. The battle is unexpected, it takes place in small tight corridors and hallways, with 1 room that they can run to. The lights can be cut out half way through the fight, making Morrigan’s team blind with disadvantage, while the rebels put on night vision goggles. The rebels fought as if they knew the colony layout and where to go, and the power cut was definitely intended. Their goal is to place down bombs and blow up the colony to the ground. They complete their mission after players are really slow at dispatching them. They vandalize by destroying murals and spray paint their symbols, **Morrigon was here.**  
- After winning the battle against the rebels, they fled, leaving messages in the battlefield, saying “Morrigon Was Here”. If the rebels win, they leave, and blow up the station, and Morrigan’s crew will be trapped on the planet. They will be able to make it out of the buried sands after hours of digging with rolls, and they will then need to survive in the harsh wind.  
- Morrigan rests in Jackson, then spends time completing the mural. During this time, she spots a gem, Shadow Agate, that’s suspiciously nervous. Eventually, she spots her leaving a secret message in a crevice within a random wall. If the rebels win, then Morrigans will travel to a forest that shields them from the winds, and find a stranded Shadow Agate who asks them to help her repair the broken signal tower next to her. She’s nervous, because it’s her who broke the signal towers, and she who shut off the power earlier, but now that she’s stranded, she can’t fix it. If this works, then a ship will come and rescue them back to Homeworld, where she will proceed with the story as usual. If not, then the message will be either in her chambers or the info can be found around the signal tower or even found from the destroyed Jackson colony.  
- The message is a meeting location and time, which is in the back of a factory in Sector Y7Z6 on Homeworld in 4 days.  
- While passing by Xelthor, an old message is broadcasted and picked up by Morrigan’s ship, which contains coordinates and an SOS signal. The coords lead to a barren field filled with drab grey bushes. There is a crashed spaceship ruin that’s been here for around 2000 years. The interiors are dusty, but clean. A large portion of the ship was destroyed in the crash that landed it there, but in one of the working rooms, a glitched transmitter randomly broadcasted a signal that was made 2000 years ago. Traces of hurriedness, items scattered about. Reactivating the ship's central console reveals that there were 2 passengers 2000 years ago, and that was a Bismuth and a Padparascha. Video footage shows them frantically getting on the ship, supported by a Globgor, who stayed behind while Bis and Pad cried. The footage showed a little bit of the outside, which is a lush green forest, a common environment to find Globgors. There’s also loot I guess. All this time, there were Kleenexes hiding in the ship, scavengers who’ve lost their food source from the ship’s leaking core. The core was cracked when the crash happened, and has been leaking radioactively, polluting the environment and killing food sources, starving local wildlife Kleenexes, although no one cares about them anyways. A choice was given to salvage the core or destroy it or leave it. Destroying it saves the Kleenexes and the local ecosystem, it also reactivates the main console that opens doors to some rooms containing loot.   
- Morrigan receives a call from Pink diamond for weekly reports. Hearing news of a yellow colony assault, Pink is excited and asks for details, but thinks it’s too much of a bad news and such a bad timing for yellow, so she decides to not inform her about it. It’s not her colony anyways, it’s not her issue. Morrigan is then excused and told to not worry about it, she would go back home to the green house and chill.  
- Few days later, Morrigan is summoned by pink, this time in yellow’s ship, where yellow and pink argue over pink’s negligence to report an invasion of one of her colonies. Yellow lacks proper agents to investigate the meetup, so she delegates Morrigan to investigate and report it directly to yellow instead, saying that for pink’s negligence, she’ll simply take one of her gems to do the job instead.  
- At the meeting place and time, Shadow Agate convenes with 4 other gems, 2 Amethysts, 1 Jasper, and 1 Zircon. They discuss the attack on Jackson, hinting at their involvement, and how Shadow Agate sabotaged the recon system so that the rebels could sneak in. Then, Shadow Agate talked about meeting Morrigan, and that they will alert Bis of her existence, see what she thinks. Other gems will be surprised to hear Morrigan’s existence. “She’s Real?” “BS\!” “No…”  
- Shadow Agate will return to Jackson, while the 4 rebels discretely fly off to Catan, using invisible cloaking technology to get past the gems.  
- In Catan, the rebels meet up with Bis, who is surprised to hear of Morrigan, and is conflicted about her next actions. She also blames Shadow and the 4 rebels for orchestrating the battle, since Jackson is a new colon, and the stunt pulled a lot of attention, despite its best intentions, which is to disrupt the colony, and give more time to a bigger attack on Oxoron that’s happening right now, in order to free it.  
- Bis moves to another building, where she speaks to Pad over the phone. They ultimately decide to not chase after her, let bygones be by gone, and focus up on the rebellion efforts. They also talk about a newly rising rebellion called the Crystal Gems, and that maybe they can go for a partnership.  
- The attack on Oxoron has been planned for years, but now the stars have aligned, and a perfect opportunity has come up to take it back from the gems and free the Talubians. Bis and Pad gets on a ship to Oxoron, starts the cloaking device along with \~20 other Morrigon ships full with rebels, and flies to Oxoron.  
- The attack on Oxoron starts after Bis and Pad’s arrival. Their target is a gem controlled city called Tubeula, once the capital of Oxorn, now the headquarters for the gems to monitor Talubians. Hidden spies turn off defensive gun turrets, allowing Morrigons to sneak into the city. Then, they surprise the gems with a massive bombing on the administrative capital building. A large-scale battle occurs between gems. The rebellion wins by default.  
- Pad and Bis make an announcement through the broadcast, saying that all Talubains are now free, declared by the Morrigons. They then occupy Oxoron for 2 weeks, securing their position and wiping out gems hiding that are still loyal to the diamonds. Then, they will bring the willing freed Talubians to the FPC, and Oxoron becomes Morrigon headquarters, and the Morrigon name becomes famous and acknowledged by the Diamonds and also FPC.

### **Act 2**

2 possible outcomes, the PCs stop the rebellion on Oxoron, or they fail to stop the rebellion.  
**PCs Succeed**  
The rebellion is stopped and one of the leaders is captured while the other manages to slip away. Morrigon is severely hurt and leaves the spotlight for a session or two, where they secretly plan for a revenge, this time focusing on taking down Morrigan instead.  
**PCs Fail**  
The rebellion succeeds, Oxoron is freed, and the Morrigons turn their focus on taking down Morrigan instead.

Either way, the plan is the same, except if PCs succeed, they have 1 less leader to worry about.  
**Plan**  
Morrigon will try to sabotage Morrigan, by first investigating her whereabouts and her history through homeworld. Two Morrigon gems from a high ranking, a Jade and a Nacre, got into inner social circles of other elite gems to ask around until they found a friend of Morrigan, an Emerald who was a neighbor and commissioned Morrigan regularly to build murals for her colonies. Through a ball that they attended together, they found out Morrigan’s job, diamond, and holdings, including the green house, her main base on homeworld.   
Later, they find her base, the green house, and then burn it down and “kidnap” all the organic life in it, liberating them and bringing them to the Morrigon side. The green house is square shaped with 5 floors, it has 4 entrances from 4 sides, all on the 3rd floor. It is powered by its own generators located on the 1st floor, powered by organic matter. The Morrigons first recon the greenhouse with camera drones that takes pictures of the green house and its interior with x-ray cameras. The drones were seen by 1 ruby guard, who didn’t think much of it, since it’s a pretty common drone. Then, after 2 days, the attack happens. A bunch of Morrigon gems infiltrate the greenhouse under the guise of minions of Morrigan’s friend Emerald who wanted to admire artworks of Morrigan. Then, they sneak into the generator room and destroy it. Without the generator, the lights are shut off, and Morrigon gems attacks and shatters the ruby guards, then takes away all the specimens, then destroying most of the artworks in the green house, before setting it all on fire.  
During the raid, Morrigons took some important files about Morrigan. Choose one:

- Ship records that indicate they went to a destroyed ship on Xelthor after being on Jackson, while having no business being there. Further investigations on Xelthor revealed that it is in fact a rebel ship.  
-   
- If Jas Kween successfully retrieved the diamond concentrate, there would be traces of it being used, but no records of it being gifted. Unapproved diamond concentrate usage is highly illegal, since it is government property and is only distributed to the most elite of gems.  
- 

Then, Morrigons will fabricate evidence to convince the gem society that Morrigan was a traitor and a spy that helped the FPC. Morrigan will be forced to flee and hide in FPC territories, and try to prove her innocence. Every step along Morrigon’s sabotage leaves some hint to reveal a pathway that can be followed to eventually get evidence of Morrigon’s involvement, but this requires them to go all over the galaxy while hiding from the gem empire. PCs need to retrieve 3 pieces of evidence to piece together counter evidence against Morrigan betrayal.  
After that’s done, Morrigan all Morrigan needs is to return to homeworld and make a case for her innocence, which will start a trial,   
Ideas:

- Hollyblue Agate is brainwashed by Morrigons?  
- Yellow attends the trial out of curiosity, and asks Morrigan to prove her loyalty by shattering a rebel gem, which will have revenge consequences.

## **Jas Kween / No King**

Newly born gem fresh out of Jackson, a new yellow colony in the eastern yellow colony cluster. 2 weeks old. Overseer for that Sector is a Heliodor, who is frustrated with Jas because of their abnormally low intelligence, and also friend with Morrigan. So they asked for a transfer, to put Jas with a gem with frequent traveling in order to gain intelligence. That gem is Morrigan. In session 1, a scene will occur in which Jas is transferred.

### **Smart Arc**

**Backstory**  
Jas is dumb because of poor birthing conditions from when they were emerging in the kindergarten. While birthing, there was a random rock in the way that wasn’t detected in the scans done by periodots. Jas had to ram through the rock, causing a generally lower intelligence.  
**Arc Progression**

- Jas meets a peridot who ridicules Jas for their stupidity after finding out they can't do a simple action. The peridot advises Jas to bathe in diamond water in order to clean out the impurities in their gem and become smart again. Diamond water is created by mixing water with any amount of diamond concentrate, which is a combination or all diamond sweats. This concentrate can heal cracks, re-fuse shattered gems, and clean all impurities. This stuff is hard to get, and priced at around 2 million Rads per 10 milliliter, and you can’t trade for it, since it’s only gifted to elite gems. The only way to get one would be to request it from your superiors, in hopes they are kind enough, and you’ll get it in a few thousand years.  
- There is a rumor about possible shipments of Diamond concentrate being stolen by rebels, overheard by Jas.  
- At the crime scene, a hidden note could be found that indicates a location for a secret deal to sell off the diamond concentrate to a gang called the Chill Dudaz. The location is at Hunchbacks.  
- After 4 days, the dealing happens. Mech Man leads the Chill Dudaz meets the rebels. A disagreement happens between the prices, and they start fighting. The Chill Dudaz wins and takes the diamond concentrate forcefully.  
- The Chill Dudaz takes the concentrate back to their base on Catan, where it is planned to be sold off again to the Piratars.   
- In order to trade with the Piratars, one must first have a trade agreement with them, which can be done with either a generous amount of donations or show yourself as a valuable trader.  
- With the trade agreement, you are given the next location and time Macan appears, and you can trade with them there.  
- The Chill Dudaz goes to the next location within the Solar Dragons in 2 weeks.  
- They enter Macan and perform the deal successfully.

## **Kris**

15 yr old human from pink diamond’s human zoo. Wears human zoo clothes and acts innocent. Wants freedom from the zoo, and stays with the gems bc that guarantees the most freedom compared to the alternative.

### **Assassin Arc**

**Backstory**  
Kris is born in the human zoo, and is innately curious. They always ask questions about why they live the way they do, and thus started exploring. With some lock picking and stealth skills, she sneaked out of her habitat and wandered about the gem facility until she was caught. The manager of the human zoo, HollyBlue Agate, a member of the hidden rebellion Morrigon, saw potential in Kris, so she trained her to be a secret assassin, doing jobs and shattering gems for Holly so the Morrigons can gain more control and secretly sabotage the Diamond Authority.   
**Arc Progression**

- Kris escapes the zoo via sunbeam, a fast small starfighter that can camouflage, given by Hollyblue Agate.  
- She flies to Jackson and hides until the right moment.  
- Kris is given a tablet to communicate with Holly, the tablet is unlocked with the secret phrase that she’ll choose when she first uses it, and Kris can only communicate to Holly through this device, and nobody else.  
- Tablet lights up with Holly giving Kris her first assignment, she says this will be a test to see whether or not Kris is capable of working for her.  
- First Task: Kill Prism Facet 7J6 Cut 9KK, who is the head coordinator for colony recon and threat detection at Jackson. She usually works alone in her control tower within the colony, which is the only part of the building visible above ground. There are 2 rubies guarding the entrance to the tower, which is otherwise pretty isolated. The kill is easy and can be done alone. This ensures that the attack happens successfully.   
- Kris’ ship is destroyed in the process, forcing her to find other ways to travel.  
- Kris informs of mission success  
- Holly Blue convenes with Pad on Pensive, discusses the next tasks and the usefulness of Kris for their mission.  
- Second Task: Kill Sanchez Hernandez or Mech Man, one a pimped out gangster in Catan, leader of the Chill Dudas, a Goblino. The other is a fully mech-ed out cyborg that's more cyborg than creature, no one knows what species they actually were. The Chill Dudas are a massive pain in the ass for Morrigans because of gang warfare between the two. Disrupting the gang by killing one of the key figures can get them off of Morrigan's back. Difficult kill because of his buddies, but it’s manageable with a team.  
- Holly Blue meets with Pad again on Melancholy. They discuss the next mission, and Pad asserts the importance of Kris’ next task.  
- Third Task: Kill Sapphire Facet 996 Cut BXM, the lead advisor for the Oxoron colony. This will ensure a smooth invasion. Since Sapphire was cracked from a workplace accident, her future vision is shoddy, which presents an opportunity to take her out of the picture for good. Eazy kill but difficult to get in and out without notice, since she has personal bodyguards and lives in a heavily fortified and secured mansion. Perhaps sneaking is the best.  
- Holly Blue meets with Pad for the final time on Oxoron if succeed else on P9. They discuss the future uses for Kris, and decide to use her as incriminating evidence against Morrigan.

## **Chrys**

Chrys is a polymorian from the planet polymoria. Polymorians live a simple life of mostly being a rock, but Chrys left his home planet for ???

### **Tree Arc**

**Backstory**  
Chrys used to punch a tree day and night, it was his best friend. There was also a tree that fell on him one time, and it hurt. The tree is angry for all those years of being punched, so after Chrys left, the tree plots revenge for years. They managed to study cybernetics and became a cyborg by controlling a mech with himself in the center, controlling it by excreting the necessary juices at the right spot. They went on to Catan and started a gang called the Chill Dudas along with Sanchez Hernandez.   
**Arc Progression**

- Mech Man chills with Sanchez in Chill Dudaz territory.  
- Mech Man spots Chrys and tries to capture him.  
- If successfully captured, Mech Man reveals his true form, tree. He then reveals the truth to Chrys, that he’s been searching for him not because of revenge, but because he missed being punched. He hated the pain, but he also missed it, he slowly learned that he loved it. He then punches Chrys repeatedly until death as a way of saying thank you, and to make him feel the same.  
- If defeated, Mech Man has a back up plan, and uploads his juices (consciousness) into a pod and launches it back to Polymoria, targeting the tree that once hit Chrys in order to take over the tree and be reborn anew to exact his revenge once again.  
- New tree builds another Mech and uses it to come back to Catan, where he will try to find the Chill Dudaz.  
- If the Chill Dudaz are gone, the tree will try to track down and find Chrys and kill him.
