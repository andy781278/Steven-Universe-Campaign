**Shapeshifting**
Any gem can stretch or shrink any part of their body for up to twice their usual size. However, for non-druids, after 1 minute of use, the gem will need to roll a finesse check per minute to keep them from reverting. The DC for the check is 12+the minutes that have passed. After being forcefully reverted, they cannot shapeshift until a short rest. ^94c408
