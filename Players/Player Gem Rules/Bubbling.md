**Bubbling**
Any gem is capable of bubbling, constraining a small item within a hand-sized bubble. The bubble floats and has very little mass/inertia. The bubble will pop upon any direct damage, and can be thrown without damaging it, as long as it is caught. Gems cannot reform while stuck in the bubble. ~~With the flick of a wrist, the bubble and its contents gets teleported to a safe physical spot in a place you would refer to as “home”~~. ^f79fd1
