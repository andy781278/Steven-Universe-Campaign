# **Playing as a gem**

Your armor acts as the durability of your physical projection. Whenever you spend armor slots, you are using your projection to block or tank attacks. Your health acts as the durability of your gemstone. Whenever you run out of armor, you are forcefully poof-ed. When you take direct damage, your gemstone is hit. Whenever your health drops to 0, your gemstone becomes cracked. This acts as the Scar mechanic in daggerheart. Whenever you get 6 scars, you shatter.
