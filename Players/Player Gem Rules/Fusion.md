**Fusion**
Gems can fuse with other gems, unless that gem is a gem hybrid, in which case they can fuse with a member of the other species they are a hybrid of. When fusing, you roll a performance check, and you need to reach a combined roll of at least 26\. Having a good and strong relationship with your partner gives you a bonus. When fused, players can roll as a single entity, adding bonuses from both sides together. When taking damage, they can choose to split the damage between them. They can also each spend an armor slot to reduce damage threshold. Immediately upon fusing, the player clears out all damages and regains all shields, but not stress. The fusion also gains a special ability, but I’m still thinking about that. Whenever one of the gems is about to poof or crack, then they are unfused, and the last tick of damage is negated, but they both fall unconscious. Voluntarily un-fuse won’t make you unconscious, but you do retain any damages you took while in the fusion. You are allowed to freely move around health and armor between each of you while in the fusion. ^601e3c
