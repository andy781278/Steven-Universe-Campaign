Newly born gem fresh out of [Jackson](app://obsidian.md/Worldbuilding/Locations/Jackson.md), a new yellow colony in the eastern yellow colony cluster. 2 weeks old. Overseer for that Sector is a Heliodor, who is frustrated with Jas because of their abnormally low intelligence, and also friend with [Morrigan](app://obsidian.md/Players/Morrigan.md). So they asked for a transfer, to put Jas with a gem with frequent traveling in order to gain intelligence. That gem is Morrigan. In session 1, a scene will occur in which Jas is transferred.
