[Kris](app://obsidian.md/Players/Kris.md) is born in the [human](app://obsidian.md/Daggerheart/ancestries/Human.md) zoo, and is innately curious. They always ask questions about why they live the way they do, and thus started exploring. With some lock picking and stealth skills, she sneaked out of her habitat and wandered about the gem facility until she was caught. The manager of the human zoo, Holly Blue Agate, a member of the hidden rebellion Morrigon, saw potential in Kris, so she trained her to be a secret assassin, doing jobs and shattering gems for Holly so the Morrigons can gain more control and secretly sabotage [the Diamond Authority](app://obsidian.md/Worldbuilding/Factions/The%20Diamond%20Authority.md).
