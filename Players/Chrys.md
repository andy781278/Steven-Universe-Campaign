[Chrys](app://obsidian.md/Players/Chrys.md) used to punch a tree day and night, it was his best friend. There was also a tree that fell on him one time, and it hurt. The tree is angry for all those years of being punched, so after Chrys left, the tree plots revenge for years. They managed to study cybernetics and became a cyborg by controlling a mech with himself in the center, controlling it by excreting the necessary juices at the right spot. They went on to [Catan](app://obsidian.md/Worldbuilding/Locations/Catan.md) and started a gang called the Chill Dudas along with Sanchez Hernandez.
