#Gems/Society

**Colony**  
Each Colony is split into Facets. Each Facet is like a national division of the overall Gem extraction and governance effort. They are massive, mostly self-sufficient, and engineered to strip the planet down to the mantle over time. These Facets are typically owned by Beryls or Diamonds.

Each Facet Contains:

- ~15 Kindergartens
- Facet Command Tower
- Diamond Observation Core (per Diamond’s inspection visits)
- Galaxy Warp Nexus
- Gem Incubation Monitoring Center
- 2x Military Fortresses (Spire-type or mobile)
- 2x Refinery/Processor Complexes
- 2x Cultural/Memorial Shrines (propaganda, control, morale)

Population Cap: ~1.8 million active Gems (assuming 20,000 per Kindergarten, distributed by caste)

**Kindergartens**  
Purpose: Birthplace of Gems; these are planetary excavation and injection sites where Gems are created by inserting mineral-seeds into the crust.  
Population:

- ~200–500 active Gems per Kindergarten
- Mostly Peridots (engineers), Quarts(security), Agates (middle management), and Pearls (assistants)
- Occasionally supervised by an Elite gem.

Workforce Roles:

- Peridots manage injection cycles, monitor energy throughput, inspect gem stability
- Quarts guard the site and neutralize corrupted spawns
- Pearls run diagnostics, clean data panels, and serve tea (to nobody)
- Agates report to their Diamond's regional command unit, typically a Beryl or other Elite Gems, and sometimes Diamonds.

Goals:

- Maintain optimal gem production without destabilizing the crust too much
- Harvest useful geological samples for refinement
- Test gem viability—defective gems are immediately recycled or shattered

Each Kindergarten produces around 20,000 gems.

**Facet Command Tower**  
Purpose: Central bureaucratic HQ of a single Facet—runs surveillance, operations, and compliance.  
Staffing:

- Beryl-Level Lead: Morganite (Yellow) or Goshenite (White)
- Mid-Rank Officials: Onyx (building managers), Zircon (legal processors), Sapphire (predictive logistics)
- Guards: Carnelian, Topaz, Pyrite
- Servants: Pearls, Spinels

Hierarchy:

- Morganite (Facet Director) reports weekly to Diamond.
- Zircons run internal tribunals.
- Onyxes manage sector-specific buildings.
- Sapphires/Padparadscha overlooks operations to see potential weaknesses.

Culture:  
Depends on the Diamond. A Yellow-run tower would be militarized and harsh; a Blue tower would be eerie and draped in aesthetic sorrow. White’s would feel like a humming CPU fan with god breathing through the walls.

**Galaxy Warp Nexus**  
Purpose: Long-distance teleportation for strategic deployment, colonial communication, and logistics.  
Staffing:

- Specialist Operator: Amazonite (spatial logistics), Lapis (gravitational alignment)
- Middle-Class Enforcers: Agates, Onyxes
- Support Techs: Bismuth, Peridots, Cobalt
- Defenders: Ruby squads, Topaz duos
- Clean-up & Harmony: Pearls, Tanzanite

Hierarchy:

- Amazonite leads warp routing
- Agates enforce travel protocols
- Lapis recalibrates the warp core every cycle

Culture:  
Blue’s Nexus would be serene, with flowing water features and crystal silence. Yellow’s would resemble an airport during war: bright, brutal, efficient. White’s would be stark—no buttons, just perfection.

I'm getting lazy, but there’s also facilities designated for resources, defense, and manufacturing, these are the majority of structures, providing jobs to the rest of the gems. There are also specialized buildings for terraforming, like atmosphere controls and tectonic plate controls. There are also mines off-colony that’s attached to colonies or are independently owned by elite gems. Dyson swarms that capture energy directly from the sun to power equipment. Reassembly and Recondition units for factory resets and shattering if needed. Many storage places for goods, and prisons for bubbled gems. Transit hubs like warehouses for logistics relay. There are also abandoned buildings and kindergartens that have either served their purpose or have been destroyed by rebellions. Off-Colors are more abundant than the government likes to admit, more on this later.
