The Diamond Authority: Each diamond performs all of the following, but each diamond has an area of expertise.

- White Diamond: The supreme leader, embodying "perfection." Controls ideology and purges deviations. Handles internal affairs and logistics of the homeworld and her colonies.
- Blue Diamond: Oversees oppression and conformity of the colonies.
- Yellow Diamond: Leads military, industry, and colonization. Oversees Gem production and gem form inspection.
- Pink Diamond: Maintains Gem relations and Culture. (Throwing balls)

Each Diamond also governs a distinct sphere of Gem society, maintaining control through their own courts that enforce their will. Their court is filled up with high-ranking aristocrats and Military Officials, who work for and meet with their diamond on a daily basis, following their direct orders. These courts are culturally distinct, each bearing the personality and goals of their diamonds. These high-ranking gems also control gems of their own, considered to be middle management, who controls the working classes.
