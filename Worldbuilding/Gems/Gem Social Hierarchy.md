The Diamond Authority: Each diamond performs all of the following, but each diamond has an area of expertise.

- White Diamond: The supreme leader, embodying "perfection." Controls ideology and purges deviations. Handles internal affairs and logistics of the homeworld and her colonies.
- Blue Diamond: Oversees oppression and conformity of the colonies.
- Yellow Diamond: Leads military, industry, and colonization. Oversees Gem production and gem form inspection.
- Pink Diamond: Maintains Gem relations and Culture. (Throwing balls)

Each Diamond also governs a distinct sphere of Gem society, maintaining control through their own courts that enforce their will. Their court is filled up with high-ranking aristocrats and Military Officials, who work for and meet with their diamond on a daily basis, following their direct orders. These courts are culturally distinct, each bearing the personality and goals of their diamonds. These high-ranking gems also control gems of their own, considered to be middle management, who controls the working classes.

Beryl: Highest ranking gems directly under diamonds, they’re tall, strong, respected, and each pretty much has a whole court of their own. 2-3m or 6-9 ft. Each diamond has around a thousand Beryls (0.003%). They control entire facets (of which there are only a few on 1 planet), asteroid mines, and other properties, and own many pearls and servants, live under luxurious conditions, attend diamond balls, and have fleets of ships under them. They speak to their diamond around once per week. Some of their jobs include being a captain of a fleet, a head engineer under a construction project for a facet of a colony, or a special operator performing missions directly ordered by their diamond. Ex: Aquamarine, Emerald, Morganite, Goshenite.

Garnets: Slightly lower ranking than Beryls, and are all army commanders. These are the most physically intimidating, strongest, and commandeering gems. They are double the size of a pearl, so around 3-4 meters or 9-12 ft. There are around a few thousand of them (0.01%). On their own, the physical prowess can almost match a diamond. They talk to their diamond about once a month. Ex: Hessonite, Demantoids, Pyropes.

Other Elite Gems: Still a part of the aristocracy and directly under the diamonds in their court. These gems aren’t as strong or valued, but they are still very respected. They usually aren’t combat focused, so they have personal guards. They talk to their diamond about once every few months. There’s a few tens of thousands of them (0.1%). Ex: Sapphire/Padparadscha (Advisors), and Heaven/Earth Beetles (Scientists/Inventors).

Specialist Gems: These are the specialists meant to do specific jobs. They work under Elite gems and sometimes diamonds to perform specific missions. They are borderline aristocratic, and have maybe 1 guard or pearl. There are around a few tens of thousands of them (0.1%). They speak to their diamond maybe once every few years. Ex: Lapis (Terraform), Desert Glass (Sand Terraform), Sugilite (Demolition), Topaz(Guard).

Middle Class Gems: Captains of small crews, Lawyers, Enforcers, and White Collar workers. These guys usually manage the lower class gems, and work directly under Elite Gems. They manage a building or an asteroid. They usually never see their diamond. There are around a few million of them (15%). Ex: Agates (enforcer/captain), Sardonyx (Engineer), Zircon (Lawyer), Onyx (Managers)

Quarts: Soldiers, built for combat and warfare. They work under their commander. There are around 10 million of them (25%). Ex: Amethyst, Jasper, Rose Quartz, Carnelian, Rainbow Quartz

Working Class Gems: Blue collar workers, armor/weapon smiths, construction workers, maintenance workers, cleaners, diggers, etc. There are around 10 million of them (25%).

Slaves: Bottom of the barrel, These are replaceable borderline gems that live to serve other higher ranking gems. Pearls, Pebbles, Spinel, Decor, Walls, Statues. There are around 12 million of them (30%).

Gem Off-Colors: Defects who can’t perform their work as intended, or looks ugly. They are persecuted by the diamond authority and live in hiding as a fugitive. There are around a few million of them (5%).
