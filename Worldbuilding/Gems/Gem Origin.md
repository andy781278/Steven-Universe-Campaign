#Gems

#### Snaple Experiment
- At some point, millions of years ago, the Snaples tried creating artificial life called gems using crystallized memory matrices—living constructs powered by ancient Snaple tech.
- Gems were made to be servants, helpers, mindless drones that do what it's told.
- But something broke, the gems gained a sort of consciousness that made it unstable, overly emotional, and overly independent.
- The prototype was deemed a failure. The Snaples scrapped it, killing all known gem prototypes, and moved on. Left the tech buried.

#### Mothergem
- All the gems were gathered up, and their gem all melted and forcefully fused together into a giant amalgamation akin to a cluster. The **Mothergem**.
- Unlike the cluster, the Mothergem was more uniform, homogeneous, and calm. It never felt the need to form, and stayed like that for a long time.
- The Mothergem contained millions of shattered gems, with the energy contained in them strong enough to be a small sun.
- These primordial gems contain great power, remnants of the Snaple Technology that was used to build them.
- These gems are significantly greater in strength compared to modern day gems, each can rival a diamond.

#### Birth of the Diamonds
- One day, a chunk of the Mothergem chipped and separated from it. Outward came the Diamonds.
- The Diamonds started with uneven surfaces and ugly exterior, but they managed to slowly refine themselves
- White, as the biggest piece, was the only one with the memory of being separated from the Mothergem, and was the first one to form. All other diamonds have no clue.
- Looking at the past memories, White decided that the only way for this specie to move forward is a fresh new start, so she perpetuated the belief of evolution, and fabricated evidence to support it.
- The other diamonds have slight memories of their time before the Mothergem, but have all long since forgotten, only glimpses of them in forgotten dreams.

#### Gem Society
- All gems have free will, and the diamonds were the strongest of them all.
- The diamonds start a gem society, using their essence to create more, although weaker underlings.
- The more gems they create, the more they have to distribute their power, and the weaker their ability to create gems.
- The first gems are the strongest, Beryls, Garnets, closest to the Diamonds.
- The latter gems are weaker, mere imitations from a tired diamond.
- The Mothergem was kept as an energy source, and it is kept on watch from fracturing anymore, as white don't want any competition.
- The planet that Mothergem is in becomes Homeworld
- They eliminated individualism for the sake of progress, perhaps as a subconscious tribute to their bygone Snaple overlords, who have done similar things to advance their civilization to such a degree.

#### Snaples Return
- On a routine check, the Snaples re-encountered the gems
- They did not expect for the gems to evolve, reproduce, and eventually build their own civilization.
- They start observing them.

Gems are humanoid creatures from the star system Mayall II of the Andromeda Galaxy. Mayall II is a quadruple-star system featuring four stars in a stable orbit; there are two very close stars orbiting each other rapidly. They are orbited by a third star as in a triple star system. These three stars are orbited by a distant fourth star. There are three planets in orbit with the most distant star, also referred to as Xypha. The closest planet orbiting Xypha is the birthplace of gems, and is referred to by the gems as “Homeworld.”

Homeworld is tidally locked to Xypha, the bright side of Homeworld has an average surface temperature of \~80 degrees Celsius, while the dark side has \~-120 degrees Celsius. There is running water in the twilight zone, along the rim of the planet. Homeworld is of a similar size and elemental composition compared to Earth. Their planet is 1.25x the size of Earth, made up of mostly oxygen and silicon, and has an iron core. Their atmosphere is 64% Nitrogen, 35% Oxygen, and 1% other gases like Argon and Carbon dioxide.
