#Gems

Gems started out their evolutionary journey as self-replicating rocks. Somehow in some way, early gems, also known as pebbles, managed to store data akin to DNA within their bodies in lattice-structured crystallines made of silicon. They then replicate themselves in a method called Fracturation, where crystal grows from their bodies until reaching a critical size, where the gem would crack into two from stress, forming two “daughter” rocks. These pebbles spread across Homeworld, taking over the planet, then started evolving. Similar to imperfections in DNA replication, imperfections in crystalline growth cause mutations to occur whenever Fracturation happens. As a result, several distinct species of Neo-pebbles sprung into existence. They had various traits but were all outshined by the first proto-gems, who unlocked the ability to photosynthesize and take energy from the sun. Xypha shines around 5 times brighter than the sun on Earth, making photosynthesis much more effective, these protogems unlock the ability of movement to get to higher places to receive more sunlight. After some evolution, they unlocked physical projections that extend outside of their gemstones, using the energy from the sun. Eventually, these gems took over the planet and became the modern gems as we know it today.
