#Gems/Society
The Gem Empire operates as an absolute, centralized Theocratic Dictatorship where authority is derived from the divine mandate of the Diamond Authority, who rule as both political leaders and living deities. The Diamonds—White, Blue, Yellow, and Pink—each oversee distinct branches of society, but ultimate power rests with White Diamond, whose word is law in all matters. There is no legislature, no independent judiciary, and no separation of powers; the Diamonds' will is executed without question by a vast bureaucracy of aristocratic Gems.

Economy & Labor

- Trade, and Currency: Gems are manufactured for specific jobs and require no sustenance besides a proximity to sunlight. That being said, having such things is quite useful. Money can be used as a drive for Gems to motivate them, gems do get tired and do yearn for leisure/commodities, money can be used to better control the gems. Selective rewards to high-performing gems generate competition, the caste system can be more stable if the nobles literally have more money, and thus more power in society beyond honorifics. Furthermore, trading with other non-gem civilizations for resources they lack is not a terrible idea, and is done often, even though most of them are at war with them.
- The currency for gems is called Radianites, or Rads for short. Radianites are similar in buying power to USD.
- Colonies are resource farms: Planets are strip-mined to produce more Gems.
- Ultimate Diamond Authority: You don’t own anything, the Diamonds own you and everything you have, they technically let you have access to them until they don’t feel like it anymore, the ultimate call is up to them.

Culture & Values

- Everything is for the service of the diamonds
- Perfection: Everything a gem does must be perfect or they shall be shunned or punished.
- Uniformity is sacred: Individuality is suppressed; "off-colors" are purged.
- Fusion is taboo: Cross-caste fusion is banned and is severely looked down upon. Same-caste fusions are fine.
- Art = propaganda: Murals, architecture, and music glorify the Diamonds. Anything else is an expression of individualism and is not allowed.

Justice & Punishment

- Courts & Trials: Punishments are resolved through trials in courts. Each diamond has their own local court to resolve local issues, which has distinct court cultures and rulings. Bigger issues are escalated to the supreme court, where the diamonds themselves are the judge and jury.
- Regular Imprisonment: Held in captivity without sunlight.
- Bubble Imprisonment: Trapped in gem, unable to form.
- Reset: Factory Reset.
- Shattering: The death penalty.
