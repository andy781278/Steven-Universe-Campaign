With Limb Enhancers
Demantoid's build is similar to that of Hessonite and Pyrope but smaller. She has dull yellow-green and a dull cool green hairstyle resembling an afro. She has a unibrow and a yellow eyepatch-like visor on her right eye as well as dull cool green eyes. She wears a black and green uniform with shoulder pads. Due to her small size she utilizes limb enhancers programmed with her Prism bigger than those of other Homeworld Gems functioning as a mech of sorts.

Without Limb Enhancers
Without her limb enhancers, she is short like Peridot 5XG. Her uniform is also similar to Peridot before her second regeneration. Her rectangular-faceted gemstone is located on her forehead above her hairline.

Demantoid behaved in a robotic, pragmatic, and businesslike manner, rarely displaying emotions. She spoke in a calm yet analytical tone and often felt exasperated by the proclamations of others. When she became angry, her demeanor changed significantly, revealing a fierce side. She strongly believed that older Gems had caused many problems, and it was the duty of newer Gems, like herself, to fix them. She was particularly upset when her limb enhancers were taken along with her Prism, and her anger intensified when she dealt with Pyrope.
