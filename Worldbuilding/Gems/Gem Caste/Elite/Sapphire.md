Sapphires are short Gems with round faces and one singular eye. Sapphires all wear ballgowns with poofy sleeves and elbow length gloves, although the additional details on their gowns can vary between them. Sapphires can have many different hairstyles, but one common feature is that they all have their eye covered by their hair regardless of what way it is styled.

Primarily, Sapphires use their future vision to assure other Gems of the future's certainty, since they can only see one possible future.
