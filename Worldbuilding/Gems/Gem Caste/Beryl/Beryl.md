#Gems/Caste

Highest ranking gems directly under diamonds, they’re tall, strong, respected, and each pretty much has a whole court of their own. 2-3m or 6-9 ft. Each diamond has around a thousand Beryls (0.003%). They control entire facets (of which there are only a few on 1 planet), asteroid mines, and other properties, and own many pearls and servants, live under luxurious conditions, attend diamond balls, and have fleets of ships under them. They speak to their diamond around once per week. Some of their jobs include being a captain of a fleet, a head engineer under a construction project for a facet of a colony, or a special operator performing missions directly ordered by their diamond.
Ex: Aquamarine, Emerald, Morganite, Goshenite, Heliodor.
