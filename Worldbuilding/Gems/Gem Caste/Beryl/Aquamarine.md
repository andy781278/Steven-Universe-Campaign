Aquamarines are very short in stature, but they make up for it with their ability to fly with water wings, in a similar way to Lapis Lazulis.
All Aquamarines shown have had a small blue bow in their hair, which has on one occasion proven to be a wand capable of radiate a cyan-colored tractor beam. They also all wear long skirts with a vest, as well as tights with blue shoes.
