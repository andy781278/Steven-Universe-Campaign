Morganite appears to be a short pink gem with long dark pink hair, blush on both of her cheeks, and half-lidded eyes. She has two thick strands dangling from either side of her face fashioned to look like paint brushes. Morganite wears a dress similar to a Japanese kimono or yukata, with a large ribbon tied around her waist.
