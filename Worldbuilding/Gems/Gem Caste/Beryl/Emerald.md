Emerald has large rectangular shoulder pads and pale furry ruff at the base of her neck. Beneath the ruff are two yellow diamond symbols one over the other, the bottom one being larger and being attached to two turquoise straps, with the rest of her jumpsuit being dark green. While her legs were not shown on-screen, her two large high-heeled boots were shown in an official lineart model sheet. She has dark green sleeves and light green, square-shaped cuffs, and a leg 'armor' the same color as her pads and cuffs. Adorning her forehead, there is a yellow zigzag tiara-esque bar that covers her hairline and brows, making it resemble a unibrow.
