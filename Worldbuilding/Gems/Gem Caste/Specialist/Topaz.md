Topazes are very large muscular gems, standing taller than Quartzes. Despite being higher up in Homeworld's caste system, Topazes show little individuality between each other and remain silent while in the presence of other gems. This may be expected of all soldiers, Topazes just being at the top of the line.
All Topazes shown in the present keep their hair in a flat-top buzz-cut style and wear an orange visor. They wear a slightly different uniform than other gems, with the diamond insignia collar being the same, but with a mahogany top underneath, and dark brown bottoms that cover their feet.
