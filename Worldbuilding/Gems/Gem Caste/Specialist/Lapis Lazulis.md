Lapis Lazulis were relatively high-ranked Gems and were very valuable to the Empire because of their powerful hydrokinesis. They are primarily used for terraforming potential colonies with their hydrokinesis. Lapis Lazulis are terraformers who reshape alien planets to be more suitable for Gem production and colonization. From what has been shown, Lapis Lazulis are incredibly powerful Gems, being capable of moving entire bodies of water with such force that it easily cuts through thick layers of rock. It is likely that this is how the canyons for Kindergartens are created, and how a planet's landmasses are reshaped by Homeworld during colonization.

Lapis Lazulis are slightly shorter than Pearls, and are very humanoid in appearance, with their blue colored skin and gem being the only indication that they are extraterrestrial.
Homeworld Lapis Lazulis are barefooted, and wear a cropped sleeveless top with a long skirt that goes just below their knees. The diamond insignia is either placed on the collar in a similar way to the most common Homeworld uniform, or split in half over the front of the top and skirt.
