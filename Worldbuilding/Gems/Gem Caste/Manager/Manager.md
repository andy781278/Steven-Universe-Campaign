#Gems/Caste 

Captains of small crews, Lawyers, Enforcers, and White Collar workers. These guys usually manage the lower class gems, and work directly under Elite Gems. They manage a building or an asteroid. They usually never see their diamond. There are around a few million of them (15%). Ex: Agates (enforcer/captain), Sardonyx (Engineer), Zircon (Lawyer), Onyx (Managers)
