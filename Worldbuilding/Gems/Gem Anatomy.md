#Gems

Physically, gems behave like any other creature, primarily bipedal and symmetrical humanoids. However, their humanoid form is only their projections, and their true self hides in the gemstone embedded somewhere on the surface of their bodies. Gems can shapeshift their projections, altering their appearance and somewhat altering their strength. Gems cannot alter their gemstones. Gems take energy from the sun via advanced photosynthesis. They can store massive amounts of energy within their gemstones, so much so that they can create extra dimensional gateways into their own “bag of holding” within their gem. When gems are heavily damaged, they dissipate their projections and accumulate energy within their gemstones in a hibernation state. Gems require constant sunlight to stay active. After a long period of time without sunlight, they will slowly lose energy and bodily functions like being unable to access extra dimensional portals or being able to form. Wait long enough, and gems start indefinitely hibernating.
