Coalition founded by Jabada Grey (Jabadahut) and Tiesto Gambino (Goblino), two good friends and Diamond Authority haters around 300 years ago. With around 15 planets and 10 moons on their side, they are created to stop the [[Diamond Authority]]’s Spread of Imperialism to establish a free democratic society. Teams up with [[Crystal Gems]] that are based on Earth around a few decades ago. Main base is called the **[[Citadel]]**, a satellite city orbiting the planet of [[Catan]], which is the most prominent free planet there is. After the new president Simion Blyat (human) took office, he pushed for change in lessening control on drugs and cybernetic enhancements, which turned [[Catan]] into a cyberpunk dystopia. [[Catan]] offers numerous cyber enhancements and drugs, many citizens are pimped out. Other free planets under the coalition are similar but not as rampant as [[Catan]], they have their own rules and followings.  
The FPC or the Coalition has been at war with the DA since its birth, they are on good terms with all other factions except for [[Snaples]], which they cannot communicate with.

There is no easy way to get to the FPC from gem territories. Most of the space between them is an [[active war zone]], full of battles between fleets that’s never ending. Even if you go through the war zone and risk death in the front lines, you still have to go through a Coalition checkpoint, where you must provide evidence of your betrayal against the empire or you will be arrested and imprisoned. The other option is to go north through the [[Carina Nebula]], where the dense nebula blocks out all signals and messes with electronics to make it extremely hard to traverse through without getting lost forever within the nebula. But nobody will be there to check you if you make it out of there.

Gems are designed with a job and immediately go to do the job after they are born. Also with supervision by manager gems, they would not have an opportunity to leave gem territories and are not allowed to do so, with exceptions like colonizers, scouts, and researchers. If a gem wants to rebel and leave gem territories, they would have to sneak out. Usually they would use military cloaking technologies that’s illegal for regular gems to have, and they secretly install it and use it to travel out. Once you break any law, you become a defector, and are wanted for detainment and trial. Military cloaking technologies can be stolen or crafted. Stealing one would be very difficult, as you have to go to one of the military bases undetected and take it from them. Military bases are very well guarded and surveilled. The other option is to craft them, this is also very difficult, but the resources to craft them can be safely and legally obtained. A well-knowledge-d engineer like Sardonyxes or Heaven/Earth Beetles are able to craft them given time, a low-level technician like Peridots would have a very hard time and would be lucky to even make a working prototype that barely functions.
