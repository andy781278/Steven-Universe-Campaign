#### History

~4000 years ago, with an increasing number of discovered space-tech civilizations that oppose the diamond authority, Yellow created project M as an experiment to try and engineer an ultimate virus that spreads without control, is hard to trace, and can annihilate all organic life it touches. They called this hypothetical virus **Malaise**. 
Yellow wanted to keep this experiment a secret, so she built laboratories on a satellite orbiting a colony planet called K2-18B in the system of JXJ. Scientists consist of Labradorites (laber), Morganites (managers), and some Peridots (tech people). Samples were collected from various alien species, and after 2000 years of trial and error, a prototype was made.  
The prototype is a self-replicating nanobot that can conceal itself to near perfection, dodging the immune systems of the host and also the best detectors the world has to offer. The machine consumes the host's nutrients to build more of itself until the host dies of malnutrition.  
The prototype was tested on the remaining Globgors on Sector 3, which worked well, perhaps too well. Along with all organic beings, all gems somehow also contracted the Malaise and started malfunctioning from a lack of energy, eventually retreating into their gem, unable to come out again, permanently. A dozen gems contracted the virus and got stuck inside their gem, and the entirety of Sector 3 got wiped out.  
Yellow quickly covered up the incident, rejuvenated any gem involved, and erased all documentation, except for 2 gems. ^4201c8

A Bismuth and a Padparadscha from Sector 3, who escaped thanks to the sacrifice of their lover, a local Globgor called Jack. Originally, Bis and Pad warned Jack and wanted to secretly transport him to another Sector, but after the virus broke out, all travel to other locations was restricted, so Jack intentionally got himself infected to steal a key to start a ship for Bis and Pad to escape.  

The ship, unfortunately, crashed and landed on a nearby planet called Xelthor. The ship was destroyed, and the landing poofed both of them, and their gems got stuck, jammed inside broken machinery, for 1000 years. After 1000 years, Xelthor was conquered by the Diamonds, and the land site was discovered. Bis and Pad were saved and returned to their homeworld. They tried to adapt to the new world and their new life, but they are too traumatized to be efficient and was soon deemed off-color. They then decided to run away from the DA to avoid being shattered.
For 1000 years, they gathered forces, created a rebellion in secret, all the while keeping up the appearance of lowly worker gems in the eyes of the diamonds. They helped create the Free Planets Coalition by sabotaging DA intel.

They discovered Malaise owes its existence to a certain Morganite called Morrigan, who supplied Project M with the necessary research specimens and generally oversaw the project as it went on. they named their rebellion “Morrigon” after the name of the gem that oversaw Project M Morrigan, plus gone, since they want Project M and all associated future possibilities of tyranny gone. The rebellion grew in secret, leaving its name on every corner. Slowly, the rebellion became more than just petty revenge; it became a symbol for anti-authoritarian and basic gem rights. Instead of protesting, they secretly sabotage gem operations to shift them in their favor. To this day, the operation is undiscovered to the gem public, and the idea of taking revenge on Morrigan is long forgotten.
