#Gems/Factions 
![[Pasted image 20251027104339.png]]
A rising force based on Earth, started by Rose Quarts who is a gem that rebelled against her own diamond after witnessing atrocities committed by her fellow gems. The Crystal Gems fight for freedom, equality, and a stop to colonial exploitation of the Diamond Authority. Currently the Crystal Gem is not a priority of the Diamond Authority, who has bigger fishes to fry. Since the Crystal Gems only occupy one planet, and they do not raid nor conquer, they are left relatively alone for now.
