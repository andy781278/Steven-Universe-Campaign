Everybody in the known galaxy shares a common currency: Radianites, or Rads. Brought forth initially by the gems, Radianite is a virtual currency with the equivalent buying power to gold in DND. 

In game, 1 handful of gold is equivalent to 1,000 Rads. 1 bag is 10,000 Rads, and 1 chest is 100,000 Rads.

- Pair costs with your income ladder to spotlight scarcity: Quartz-class soldiers (60–96 k Rads/year) can buy casual energizers regularly but must petition for military-grade doses, while Worker-class gems (36–60 k) feel the bite of even legal relaxants.
- Coalition free ports—especially Catan’s cyberpunk arcology rife with drugs and cybernetics—make ideal hubs to obtain the more illicit entries like Starfall Mist or smuggled comfort pods.
- Because Rads roughly mirror USD purchasing power, you can eyeball prices for additional human imports by mapping them to luxury goods on modern Earth, then adjust for interstellar scarcity.

Here's a list of incomes
Beryl & Garnet: 1 - 3 million Rads / year
Elite: 240,000 – 360,000 Rads / year
