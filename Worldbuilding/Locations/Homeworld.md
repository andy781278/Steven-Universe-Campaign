#Gems/Locations
![[Pasted image 20251027104816.png]]
Home of the gems, Homeworld is filled to the brim with technology, administrative centers, temples, and the strongest army in the known universe.

The core is powered by the Mothergem, hidden deep in the planet's core. Heavily guarded by white's grand army.

White Diamond’s **Grand Army** is composed of 4 fleets, each led by a Goshenite, and all directly controlled by White Diamond to ensure complete control, loyalty, morale, and tactics.  
### Locations
Homeworld is split into 4 levels separated by vertical depth, with level 1 being the highest peaks, and 2 being under that, and level 4 being the core. Homeworld has long been drilled  hollow, and there is no true 'surface' to stand on anymore, only segments and parts, roads and architecture made by gems.
Each level is separated into Sectors. Unlike colonies, homeworld sectors are not diamond specific, but instead task specific. 
#### Level 1
Bourgeoisie luxurious highrises, home to the elites of society like Beryls and Garnets, and their servants/workers. All sorts of wondrous castles and estates built for entertainment of these elites, including the Diamonds. Each elite gets their own estate for luxury.

##### Diamond Sector
A traditional flat sector in the shape of a diamond, built solely for the home of the four diamonds. The sector is split into 4, each signified by a landing pad where the diamond vehicle rests. This land has been untouched by expansion and renovations of technological advancements for the sake of nostalgia by white's request.

##### **Gilded Stacks**
A colossal restricted library of cultural and information archives. Mostly propaganda. Elite can request curated information to shape their worldview on demand.

##### Beryl Vistas Sector
Rows of suspended spherical Estates with customizable atmosphere and other amenities for each estate. Fashionable residence choice. Weather becomes a status display.

#### Level 2
The bulk of the gem population works here. Middle class and working class, warehouses, factories, managers, coordinators, laborers, builders, machinists, and plain office workers. Most of them live and die within 5 km of their designation their whole life. They have rest times, but it is held in communion barracks. Monotonous. Their jobs usually does not require them to go anywhere else, and thus they can't and don't.

#### Level 3
Mega Kindergartens spanning hundreds of thousands of miles long. Most of it is tapped dry and left to be abandoned. Some parts are still functioning and producing gems, but this is not a priority of the DA in any form. Off-Colors who were deemed worthless often hide within these kindergartens to avoid shattering.

#### Level 4
The Core is the most secure region in any DA territory. It is a zero-g spherical structure built with the strongest metals. It contains the mothergem that powers homeworld, and is constantly guarded by swarms of droids and soldiers. This level is hidden away from the public, and rarely anyone knows about it. Any gem who discovers it is immediately arrested and executed, no one can know.

### Events
**Social Event** - Elite gems randomly get asked to attend social events like balls or gatherings. Participants are usually other elite gems, but they often bring bodyguards and +1s that are within their circle. Useful for knowledge gain, building connections, and asking for favors.
Attendees: Goshenite, Heliodor, Emerald, Morganite, Aquamarine, Lapis Lazulis, Sapphire, Opal, Moonstone, Pearl (servant), Ruby/Quartz (bodyguard).  

**Court Case** - In the case of crime, a court shall be held, just like real life. There are 3 different kind of courts, finally reaching the diamond court. Zircons dominate these, as well as administrative workers like Rutiles or Onyx.
