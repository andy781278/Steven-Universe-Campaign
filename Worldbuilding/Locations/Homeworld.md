#Gems/Locations

Home of the gems, Homeworld is filled to the brim with technology, administrative centers, temples, and the strongest army in the known universe.

### Locations
Homeworld is split into 4 levels separated by vertical depth, with level 1 being the highest peaks, and 2 being under that, and level 4 being the core. Homeworld has long been drilled  hollow, and there is no true 'surface' to stand on anymore, only segments and parts, roads and architecture made by gems.
Each level is separated into Sectors. Unlike colonies, homeworld sectors are not diamond specific, but instead task specific.

**Court Case** - In the case of crime, a court shall be held, just like real life. There are 3 different kind of courts: Local Court, Sector Court, and Luminous Diamond Court. Zircons dominate courts as lawyers, as well as administrative workers like Rutiles or Onyx.
