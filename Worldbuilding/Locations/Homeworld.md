Home of the gems, Homeworld is filled to the brim with technology, administrative centers, temples, and the strongest army in the known universe.

The core is powered by the Mothergem, hidden deep in the planet's core. Heavily guarded by white's grand army.

White Diamond’s **Grand Army** is composed of 4 fleets, each led by a Goshenite, and all directly controlled by White Diamond to ensure complete control, loyalty, morale, and tactics.  

### Locations


### Events
**Social Event** - Elite gems randomly get asked to attend social events like balls or gatherings. Participants are usually other elite gems, but they often bring bodyguards and +1s that are within their circle. Useful for knowledge gain, building connections, and asking for favors.
Attendees: Goshenite, Heliodor, Emerald, Morganite, Aquamarine, Lapis Lazulis, Sapphire, Opal, Moonstone, Pearl (servant), Ruby/Quartz (bodyguard).  

**Court Case** - In the case of crime, a court shall be held, just like real life. There are 3 different kind of courts, finally reaching the diamond court. Zircons dominate these, as well as administrative workers like Rutiles or Onyx.
