The General Fabrication Sector is a sprawling industrial district where common-issue gem accessories, standard hard-light implements, and mass civilian goods are manufactured, assembled, and calibrated. The sector consists of stacked fabrication halls arranged in radial symmetry, each dedicated to a singular micro-task. Conveyor bridges move components through dozens of nearly identical bays, while low-status workers perform monotone calibrations under the glow of authority-green ion fields. Thick resonance pipes hum through the walls, distributing stabilized energy to power tools, barracks infrastructure, and higher-level logistics. Nothing here is remarkable to the inhabitants; every object produced is standardized, inspected, logged, and stored into crystalline cargo coffers.

Gems born or assigned to this span typically work within five kilometers of their assembly line for their entire existence. Communion barracks and nutrient-gel dispensers are arranged in tight clusters between factories so workers never need to travel far. The air smells faintly of ionized metal and lubricant gel. Supervisors drift above on floating observation platforms, monitoring quotas and audible compliance.
