centralized district where all administrative duties are recorded, processed, and archived. Towering record spines store holographic profiles of every gem residing in the surrounding kilometers — origin, function, performance history, designation rank, and reassignment eligibility. Quiet hallways connect to authorization booths where workers request permission for basic needs: shift adjustments, barrack transfers, or medical clearance. Clerks verify identity tags, update residency codes, and stamp authorization glyphs in solemn silence. Every movement is tracked; every change requires justification. Messenger drones glide between floors delivering summoning slips for routine audits, while overseer pods drift overhead, listening for policy violations and conversational deviations. Most gems assigned here spend cycles copying data, merging files, and validating records, never questioning what the information is ultimately used for. For leadership, this sector ensures order and traceability. For workers, it is an endless ledger of identities that are all equally replaceable.
