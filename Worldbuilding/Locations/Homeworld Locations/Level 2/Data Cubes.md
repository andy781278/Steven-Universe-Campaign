Randomly scattered about level 2 are data cubes, these massive geometric hard-light lattices are  used to store, modify, and regulate **gem essence imprints**—the metaphysical code that defines every gem’s personality, function, and behavioral parameters. It acts as a sector-wide archive of identity data, sampling each gem regularly to track emotional drift, loyalty variance, and task performance. Authorized architects can design or update **blueprints** inside the Cube, altering existing gem types, issuing behavioral patches, or even engineering entirely new models. Through harmonic broadcasts, these changes propagate invisibly across the workforce like firmware updates.

The Cube’s most feared function is **rejuvenation**, a “factory reset” that wipes accumulated memories, relationships, and emotional development, restoring a gem to baseline compliance while leaving their body intact. To the state, this is maintenance; to workers, it is the quiet erasure of a living person. As an instrument of social stability, the Data Cube prevents individuality, suppresses unauthorized growth, and enforces identical purpose across entire sectors. Identity becomes software—editable, overwritable, and disposable—ensuring Homeworld remains orderly, uniform, and eternally controlled.
