Vast industrial district dedicated to harvesting, refining, and distributing fusion energy. Towering helix-stacks cycle plasma streams through layered magnetic fields, while ridged processing halls assemble fuel capsules and capacitor housings. The entire sector glows an eerie green because of atmospheric ionization fields designed to suppress stray radiation and stabilize harmonic resonance. Workers perform monotonous calibration tasks, adjusting pressure valves, aligning focusing mirrors, and replacing melted shield plates. Most will never understand the scale of what they’re servicing.

The district helps power ships, small components, limb enhancers, and small gadgets.
