enormous ship-construction sector dedicated to producing standardized vessels for transport, patrol, and military deployment across Gem territory. Towering drydock frames suspend half-finished hulls in mid-air while rotating gantries allow workers to weld, plate, and calibrate components under strict quota schedules. Engines and thruster bells are forged in adjacent furnace bays, then hoisted into position by magnetized cranes. The sector is loud, hot, and heavily surveilled; production delays trigger immediate oversight intervention. Workers spend their entire lives performing narrow tasks—riveting armor plating, wiring resonance thrusters, or polishing sensor arrays—without ever seeing the finished craft depart. When a ship launches, it rises through a sealed launch shaft toward higher levels, its destination unknown to those who built it. Communion barracks ring the perimeter, ensuring a constant, rotating workforce.
