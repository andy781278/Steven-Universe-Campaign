The military and strategic capital of Homeworld, the equivalent of the Pentagon of the US government. This sector is home to **White Diamond’s Legion**, which is a grand army composed of 4 fleets, each composed of hundreds of ships and led by an arm ship. Each fleet is led by a Goshenite, and all directly controlled by White Diamond to ensure complete control, loyalty, morale, and tactics.
