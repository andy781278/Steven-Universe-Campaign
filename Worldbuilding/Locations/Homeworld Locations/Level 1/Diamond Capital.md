A traditional flat sector in the shape of a diamond, built solely for the home of the four diamonds. The sector is split into 4, each belonging to one of the diamonds. The center of the sector is a landing pad where the diamond ships are parked. This land has been untouched by expansion and renovations of technological advancements for the sake of nostalgia by white's request.
