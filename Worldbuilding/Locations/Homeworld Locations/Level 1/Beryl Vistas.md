### Events
##### Social Event
Elite gems randomly get asked to attend social events like balls or gatherings as a part of their court culture. Participants are usually other elite gems and their slaves or bodyguards, gems within their circle. Useful for knowledge gain, building connections, and asking for favors.

Hosts: Goshenite, Heliodor, Emerald, Morganite, Aquamarine,
Attendees: Jade, Goshenite, Heliodor, Emerald, Morganite, Aquamarine, Lapis Lazulis, Sapphire, Pearl (servant), Ruby/Quartz (bodyguard).

Process: After brief introductions of the host, Jades begin dancing along with other attendees, dancing occurs in rounds, where each gem type gets their turn, and the rest is freely allowed to socialize.
In serious important diamond balls, formality requires strict schedule and uptightness. However, in your every day ball hosted and for elites, it is looser.
