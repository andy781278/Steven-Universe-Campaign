The Core is the most secure region in any DA territory. It is a zero-g spherical structure built with the strongest metals. It contains the mothergem that powers homeworld, and is constantly guarded by swarms of droids and soldiers. This level is hidden away from the public, and rarely anyone knows about it. Any gem who discovers it is immediately arrested and executed, no one can know.
