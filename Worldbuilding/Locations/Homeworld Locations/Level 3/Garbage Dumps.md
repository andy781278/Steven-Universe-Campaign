Homeworld's sole garbage dump covering a remnant of an ancient gem city from 20,000 years ago. The air is musty and filled with dust. Abandoned, cracked gems barely survive scavenging for gem shards to fuse themselves to stop them from shattering. This is one of the Off-Colors' popular designation. Frequent visits from Incinerators: massive ships that gobble up whatever's in their sight and melt it down for repurposing, no matter alive or not.
