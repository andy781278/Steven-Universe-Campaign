A small city size area where a natural protective shield of periodic electromagnetic pulses stop any droids from being within the vicinity. As a result the DA has no clue of the existence of such a safe-haven for the Off-Colors, so when a group of them caught wind of this, they immediately made it their home. This area harbors the greatest concentration of Off-Colors in the scale of millions of gems. They built atop the ancient forgotten gem city from 20,000 years ago, and live in peace. This land is called Paradise by the Off-Colors, and is a dream place that all Off-colors yearn to go to. However, the location of this city is so secretive, not a lot of Off-colors know the exact location, and often wound up lost in the other parts of Level 3. Those who do make it, however, can enjoy peace away from the DA for the foreseeable future.
