A giant cloud of chaotic storms and energy surges, the Carina Nebula is shrouded in mystery because of the EMP shockwaves that occur while inside the nebula, crews that venture inside often wound up missing. Equipment fails half the time. For these reasons, not much effort has gone into colonizing or exploring areas within the nebula, who knows what dangers lurk in the unknown.  
**Nebula Mist** - High energy mist that absorbs most of the electromagnetic spectrum. After being exposed to the nebula mist for 5 minutes in real life, all signals coming in and going out will be blocked. Furthermore, in real life, for every 30 minutes, a random 5 minute surge of EMP waves will disable all electronics, causing ships to malfunction, losing control. All energy-dependent technology also malfunctions, like weapons, limb enhancers, or phones. Furthermore, being directly exposed to the hot mist will req str or ins reaction roll DC 15 every turn or cause burns that damage for 2d10 physical. If you are covered with heat-absorbing material then you have advantage on your roll.  
**Traverse the Nebula** - Snaple technology somehow bypasses the nebula and can navigate it with ease. These technologies can be found within Snaple research facilities and can be used with a DC 21 Knowledge Check. The device is a polyhedron purple crystal that fits on your hand, on activation the crystal glows purple and asks the user with the user’s language within their mind on where to apply the protection, it can be used on a ship, or up to a dozen people.  
**Snaple Research Station** - Random Snaple research facilities can be found. They’re usually built on asteroids, isolated, and only house a few dozen Snaples. These stations have automatic laser railguns that shoot any incoming obstacles, whether it be garbage, asteroids, or ships. When hit by the railgun, the ship would immediately blow up, exposing the crew to the mist. The railgun will fire within 500 ft, and everyone has 1 turn to react before being exposed to the mist. Everyone can then run (agility roll) ft per turn until they reach the facility, where they now need to try and open up a locked door thru either brute force (20), disabling the mechanism (19), or inputting the password.
