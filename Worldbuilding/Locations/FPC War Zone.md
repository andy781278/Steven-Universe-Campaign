![[Pasted image 20251027105112.png]]Largest war in the known region between the DA and the FPC for 300 years. Nowadays, this is a large region filled with ancient debris, battlefields, destroyed planets, shattered gems and dead aliens everywhere. Scavengers fill the land wherever the war combatants are not present, the place is a lawless mayhem. There is a particular star within the zone containing a planet that is the culmination of the zone’s chaos: **[[Brighton]]**.
