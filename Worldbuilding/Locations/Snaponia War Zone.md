Place of active warfare between Snaples and the DA. The Diamonds initiated the war by sieging and taking Snaponia by surprise, a valuable Snaponian planet. The planet had many valuable ores and technology, but most of the technology is undecipherable, and most of the facilities were destroyed by the Snaponians themselves as a method of Scorched Earth. Taking the planet was not easy, many ships were destroyed and gems lost, while most of the Snaponians managed to escape. The losses were about 5:1, for every 5 gems lost, only 1 Snaple was lost. Since then, the DA kept up a front line and a defensive position, waiting for Snaponian countermeasures, but it never came. There were sometimes skirmishes made by small teams, but never a huge invasion. The Diamonds are on full alert, skeptic and careful, preparing for the worst possible scenarios, while being completely shrouded in mystery. The Zone is banned for civilian Gems to this day, and Snaponia became a mine and a prison for Snaples who got captured.
