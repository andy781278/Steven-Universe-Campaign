![[Pasted image 20251027105129.png]]Originally home to a now extinct race of bird people, Brighton has been switching back and forth between the hands of DA and [[The Free Planets Coalition|FPC]] for a while now. This place is a constant battlefield, conqueror, terror, bombardment, command center, a valuable resource, and the key to winning the war. Currently stuck on the planet are broken crippled soldiers from all sides gathering together and trying to survive and get home. Crippled soldiers and cracked gems are often abandoned, leaving them to fend for themselves on the planet. Most signs of life have been lost on the planet, the entire surface is a dark charcoal dust. Frequent windstorms pick up everything off of the ground, camping is impossible. Craters everywhere, destroyed nations and cities litter throughout the place, bandits create factions and raid each other. The sun is shrouded by the dense ash that rains down from the sky, caused by a nuclear winter that’s been here since the beginning of the war. At night, temperature lowers to -30 degrees Fahrenheit, and freezes most organisms.
