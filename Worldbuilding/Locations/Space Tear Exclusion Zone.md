Created a few thousand years ago from an experiment gone wrong. The exclusion zone contains a permanent tear in the fabric of spacetime, causing all surrounding space to be unstable and prone to collapse. Any matter touching the crack is consumed, never to be seen again, fueling the crack to grow further, similar to a black hole. Furthermore, any matter that enters the exclusion zone is close enough to the tear to make themselves dangerously unstable. There have been reports of entire ships teleporting around, growing and shrinking, contracting glitch-like deformities. Creatures can change to older or younger versions of themselves, people can see their past and future. Hallucinations, vomiting, excruciating pain, any creatures affected by the tear has to be put down.  

**Hallucinations** - for every 5 minutes after entering the zone, creatures will need to succeed a reaction roll str or ins or start seeing their future self and past self, see memories of the past from a different perspective, traumas, desires, and anything stimulating,  

**Permanent Damage** - 1 hour after entering the zone, creatures will need to roll an instinct check DC 20 or else take 3d10 physical damage and have one body part malformed.
