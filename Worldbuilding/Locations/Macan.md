Home to the [[Piratars]]. Macan is a planet of lawlessness and chaos, full of drunken old sailors (space sailors) wanting to pick a fight with the first person they see. Piratars have stolen countless ships, raw resources, and slaves from the [[DA]], and is an absolute menace the DA fully intends on stopping. ^baa114

The only issue is the secrecy of Macan’s location, which seems to change from time to time, and can never be completely located. Many times have the gems managed to capture and torture Piratars for the location of Macan, but every time they turn up shorthanded. ^fcecd2

The answer is that Macan is a planet with a built-in warp drive that can drive itself around with a camouflage exosphere. They are never in the same location for more than a few weeks, and their sensors can detect gem ships coming from light years away. ^2c6332

The only way for the DA to stop the Piratars would be to secretly infiltrate Macan and shut down the warp drive from the inside, which is insanely difficult, given that it has not been accomplished yet, and the Piratars have been existing for a century or so. ^15c585

Macan has a swampy biome full of water and mud, wooden structures were built on top, often molded and corroded, barely still standing. FPC influences still present, cybernetics like prosthetic arms and laser eyes, arm gun or enhanced physique. If Catan is Detroit, then this would be Australia.  

**Difficult Access** - In order to know where and when Macan will appear next, you need to consult a Certified Macan Diplomat, which can be found all over the FPC, give up the mandatory donation, usually 1 bag of Rads, then go through background checks, just to make sure you’re not a DA spy or an enemy of Macan that’s on a blacklist. After everything’s been approved, you are given a traders agreement, and a location and time for Macan’s next destination. Macan moves every 2 weeks.  

**Scam** - Little children will take advantage of their appearance and the planet’s complicated navigation by acting as a guide and secretly pocket the foreigners' money. DC 19.
