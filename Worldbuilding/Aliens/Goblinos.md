Red rat-like Goblinos are cunning small tricksters that are the original settlers to **Catan**, the most prominent free planet of all time. Sitting at around 3-4 ft, they love chocolate shortcakes and not wearing a shirt. They led Catan to space-age and took over the solar system, met the Gems and fought a war with them, which ended on a stalemate because of the Goblino’s excellent guerilla warfare battling on homeland and their good resource management and bustling industry, which is laissez faire, allowing alien immigrants to come and go as they please. Slowly, their resistance is heard by other persecuted alien races and they all come swarming to their homeland, Catan, which tripled its population after winning the war, and became a lot more unstable and ruthless, kind of dystopian after a new president by the name of Simion Blyat took office and started hard selling drugs. Catan offers numerous cyber enhancements and drugs, many citizens are pimped out. Goblinos are the Diamond Authority’s 2nd biggest enemy right after the Snaples.
