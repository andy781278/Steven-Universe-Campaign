Gluttonous giant slugs from planet Xelthor. Evolved in a planet originally controlled by Globgors, and raised as pets and a spectacle in zoos. Genetically altered to optimize fat gain and retention, and a humongous appetite. Jabadahuts were chilling until Globgors nuked each other out, and then used Globgor technology to invent space travel, where they met and fought gemkind before losing their home planet and fled to Free-planets. Nowadays, they run restaurants, bars, they love to be the center of attention, and they need to consume 200,000 calories a day. Every Jabadahut has Jabada as their first name and their own name as last name.
