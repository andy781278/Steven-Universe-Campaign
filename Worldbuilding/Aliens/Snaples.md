Short for Snake People, Snaples originated from the Snaponian Galaxy, and traveled here through artificial wormholes, which are different from FTL technology that the Gems invented. Little is known about Snaples as their language is so complex and different that no translation method is discovered. The only known fact is that they are dangerous and aggressive. 

They came into contact with Gemkind about a few decades ago, and are very new to the Gems.

Snaples are equipped with technology so advanced that the gems do not yet understand, but they do understand that they can perform the following:
- **Wormhole Creation**: travel between galaxies. No gem has seen the other side.
- **Advanced Terraform**: alter the composition of the atmosphere and planet itself
- **Antimatter Weapon**: weapons that destroy the target through antimatter obliteration, used for destroying entire planets.
- **Immortality**: Dead Snaples who's body is completely destroyed seen alive the next day somewhere else. It seems like there's a way to capture Snaple souls and reconstruct their body, then putting the soul back into the new vessel

A single well-equipped Snaple can take out a squadron of Quarts.
Snaples could easily wipe out Gemkind, the exact reason why they have not done so is unknown, but speculations from experts predict that it’s perhaps for amusement.
As humiliating as it is for gemkind, they must admit defeat and focus on research to crack the Snaple language so they can steal their technology and conquer them.
Snaples do not contact any other race, and only pop in with wormholes from time to time, build a few buildings or mines.
They usually kill other races on-sight, but some are chill enough to live amongst others in free-planets, but they are still very cold and elusive.
Physically, Snaples are dominating but not overly so, 6-7 ft in height, and usually muscular but not stronger than elite quarts. 

Snaples are each carefully genetically designed and grown in labs. They are stripped of any potentially-dangerous thoughts to the Snaples, and exist only to benefit their society. They are made to conform and follow orders.
