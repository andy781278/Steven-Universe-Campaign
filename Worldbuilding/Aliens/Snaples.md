Short for Snake People, Snaples originated from the Snaponian Galaxy, and traveled here through artificial wormholes, which are different from FTL technology that the Gems invented. Little is known about Snaples as their language is so complex and different that no translation method is discovered. The only known fact is that they are dangerous and aggressive. They came into contact with Gemkind about a few decades ago, and are very new to the Gems. Snaples are equipped with technology so advanced that the gems do not yet understand, but they do understand that they can perform the following:

- Wormhole creation to travel between galaxies. No gem has seen the other side.
- Advanced terraform, alter the composition of the atmosphere and planet itself
- Antimatter Weapon, weapons that destroy the target through antimatter obliteration, used for destroying entire planets.

A single well-equipped Snaple can take out a squadron of Quarts. Snaples could easily wipe out Gemkind, the exact reason why they have not done so is unknown, but speculations from experts predict that it’s perhaps for amusement. As humiliating as it is for gemkind, they must admit defeat and focus on research to crack the Snaple language so they can steal their technology and conquer them. Snaples do not contact any other race, and only pop in with wormholes from time to time, build a few buildings or mines. They usually kill other races on-sight, but some are chill enough to live amongst others in free-planets, but they are still very cold and elusive. Physically, Snaples are dominating but not overly so, 6-7 ft in height, and usually muscular but not stronger than elite quarts.  

**The Truth**  
At some point, millions of years ago, the Snaples tried creating artificial life called gems using crystallized memory matrices—living constructs powered by ancient Snaple tech. Gems were made to be servants, helpers, mindless drones that do what it's told. But something broke, the gems gained a sort of consciousness that made it unstable, overly emotional, and overly independent. The prototype was deemed a failure. The Snaples scrapped it, killing all known gem prototypes, and moved on. Left the tech buried. But they did not expect for the gems to evolve, reproduce, and eventually build their own civilization. All gems have free will, and the diamonds were the strongest of them all. The diamonds seized power, took over gem society, and eliminated individualism for the sake of progress, perhaps as a subconscious tribute to their bygone Snaple overlords, who have done similar things to advance their civilization to such a degree. Snaples are each carefully genetically designed and grown in labs. They are stripped of any potentially-dangerous thoughts to the Snaples, and exist only to benefit their society. They are made to conform and follow orders.  
Nonetheless, Snaples returned after millions of years, and are amazed by the gems, so they start observing them. Snaple technology appears god-like compared to gem-tech. They have resurrection devices that make them functionally immortal, they have so many numerous advanced tech that makes everything in this galaxy look like toys, so they didn’t both have defenses, and just stuck to research.
