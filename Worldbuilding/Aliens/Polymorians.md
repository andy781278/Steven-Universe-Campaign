Large crystal golem people, incapable of verbal communication, but uses sign language. Hibernates ⅘ of their life, which means every 5 years, there is only 1 year in which they are awake. Although they can wear clothes, they value attractiveness based on how shiny and refractive they are, so they don’t wear clothes. Polymorians can choose to not hibernate when their time comes, there is no consequence, the hibernation is completely optional, it’s just that Polymorians love hibernating and being a rock. They are genderless, but all have male pronouns. They reproduce by bathing in lava together until pieces of themselves get stuck together, then they rip the piece off, and that piece sucks in lava energy to grow until a new one appears. Polymorians can regenerate any body part after a while, but they do not grow larger than their designated size. The largest Polymorian automatically becomes king. They live in a feudalistic society with castles, lords, and farming. Their main food source is sand, which they eat with their feet, and can farm by putting rocks in the riverbed, and let rivers grind down the rock until it's fine as sand. Polymorians don’t age and live until they are destroyed, some are millions of years old.
