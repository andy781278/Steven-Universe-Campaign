#Aliens 
Silicon-based life forms based on the planet of Oxoron. 5 ft Height.
They dominated their planet with their high intelligence and pack tactics. 
They’re physically nimble but flimsy, they are very serious but sound funny. Without tubes, they crawl around like worms. They consume sunlight and microscopic tube worms that function similarly to Talubians but are tiny. The tube worms eat smaller tube microorganisms that eat tube compounds that came from tube volcanoes. 

They formed a society focusing on building infrastructure with their dead bodies. Old Talubians expand and become permanent transparent silicon tubes that other Talubians can crawl through, these tubes end up covering the whole planet, and with some good old technology with a vacuum, they can traverse through the planet effortlessly, reaching up to 500 mph in the tube systems. They eventually also built their homes and infrastructure around their tubes, so all buildings are transparent and a part of transportation. They are currently in the Industrial Age.
Came into contact with the Gem race around 200 years ago, and has been conquered and is considered a tribute state of the diamond authority. Forced to build platforms and roads for Gems, and also built a governmental building that’s mostly run by gems, that’s made of regular stone. ^f71be1
