#Aliens
Gems do no control all life-filled bodies that they have discovered, but for those they did control, they do not outright genocide them, but instead enslave them, and administer a process of selective sterilization and let the specie slowly die out. For those that they do not control, it is most likely a lack of resources or time, plus a number of other factors. There are some resistance groups that consist of aliens and some gems who band together in sectors free of diamond authority’s control, these territories are called free-planets for them and rebel-planets for gems under the diamond authority.
